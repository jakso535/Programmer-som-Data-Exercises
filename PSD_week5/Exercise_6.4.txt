1. In the let-body, the type of f should be polymorphic—why?
    
    Because we cannot guarantee that x and f are of the same type, and therefore, f should be polymorphic.

2. In the let-body, f should not be polymorphic – why?

    Here, f is only ever called with x or x+1, such that if doesn't need to be polymorphic, as it only takes one type.
